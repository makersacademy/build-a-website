## Step 3: Adding some style

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the technology we use to define the layout and design of our websites (remember, HTML is for structure and content). Using CSS, we can elevate our website from just black text on a white background.

We are not looking to win any design awards here, just to demonstrate the principles of styling a website. To begin with, let's choose a background. Go to [Subtle Patterns](http://subtlepatterns.com) and choose any background that you like. It will help if your background is light not dark. Download the background you have chosen from the website and unzip it.  For example (unzipped):

![ricepaper](/images/step_3/ricepaper.png)

Create a `public` folder in your workspace and an `images` folder inside `public`:

![public/images folder](/images/step_3/public_images_folder.png)

Now upload the background image you have chosen (the smaller if there is more than one - `ricepaper_v3.png` in this example) to `public/images`.  You'll find an 'Upload Local Files...' option under 'File' menu in Cloud9. Alternatively, you could just drag & drop the file to the folder.

To set this as the background image of our website, we can add some CSS directly to the `index.erb` file by adding a `style` attribute to the `<body>` tag:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
<body style="background-image: url(/images/ricepaper_v3.png)">
  <h1>Motivational Posters</h1>
  <p>By tonight I'll have a fully-functioning website!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Save the file and reload the page in Cloud9.  It should now look like this:

![Applying ricepaper background](/images/step_3/applying_background.png)

The CSS we just added tells the browser to render the **body** of our page - i.e. everything that's visible on the screen - with the specified background image.  Once upon a time, all CSS was added directly inline in the HTML like this.  However, as with the previous step, this is going to be difficult to read and maintain.  We want to put all of our styles in a separate file (or files).

Create a folder `css` inside the `public` folder.  Create a file called `application.css` inside `public/css`.  We will put *all* of our styling instructions in this file, so please remove the `style` attribute added to `index.erb` in the previous step.

Add the following to `public/css/application.css`:

```css
body {
  background-image: url(/images/ricepaper_v3.png);
}
```

Obviously, you'll need to substitute `ricepaper_v3.png` if you chose a different background.

You can interpret this CSS code as being the following instruction to the browser: *render any `body` element on the page using the background image found at the URL `/images/ricepaper_v3.png`*. (In the case of `body`, there should be only one element on the page.)

Refresh the browser now.  Did it work?  Did you expect it to work?  It doesn't matter whether you were right or wrong - what matters is how you use that outcome to progress.  Take a few moments to consider the changes we just made and how they might have affected the outcome.

The answer is that the browser doesn't know anything about `public/css/application.css`.  Why would it?  It's our responsibility to tell the browser about this external stylesheet.  Fortunately, that's another fundamental part of the way the web works and it's as simple as adding a new element to the `<head>` element of our HTML:

```html
<head>
  <link href="/css/application.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
  <title>Motivational Posters</title>
</head>
```

> Note how the `/public` prefix is missing from the beginning of the path to both the stylesheet and the background image in the CSS file.  This is related to the way Sinatra works.
